# MPU6050
MPU6050 is a compact 6-axis motion tracking sensor that combines a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope in a single chip. It communicates via the I²C interface and is widely used for motion sensing, orientation detection, robotics, drones, and IoT applications due to its high accuracy, low power consumption, and reliable performance.
